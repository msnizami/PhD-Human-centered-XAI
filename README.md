# Welcome!
I am a PhD researcher in "Explainable AI" at the University of Urbino, Italy.
The main focus of PhD research is to design and develop frameworks and tools for "Human-centered explanations" with a speacial focus on Human-centered Counterfactual Explanations.
This work also focus on the study of human cognition levels of understanding to design/generate better explanations.
